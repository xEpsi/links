## My socials' page

![Screenshot from the Repl](https://i.ibb.co/HBbLDPn/image.png)


This website was made with [React](https://reactjs.org/). It's a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

For the frontend, I used [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/), an open-source TypeScript based [React](https://reactjs.org/) components library, which includes more than 120 customizable components and hooks.

I also used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.
